This project is forked from ashima0109/FaceRecognition.
This version adds the possibility to create a clean copy of all the images where a match was found, together with a csv file with the list of the files.
This version automatically skips non- image files (files with extension different from jpg, jpeeg, gif, png) without stopping for error.
A file (test3) with no matches for test purposes is included.
